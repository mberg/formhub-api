<h3 id='success'>Success</h3>

<p>Success differ from errors in that their body may not be a simple response object with a code and a message. The headers however are consistent across all calls:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>GET</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code> returns <code>200 OK</code> on success,</li>

<li><code>POST </code> returns <code>201 Created</code> on success,</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='error'>Error</h3>

<p>Error responses are simply returning <a href='http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html'>standard HTTP error codes</a> along with some additional information:</p>

<ul>
<li>The error code is sent back as a status header,</li>

<li>The body includes an object describing both the code and message (for debugging and/or display purposes),</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, for a call with when the resource is not found:</p>

<p><code>Status: 404 Not Found</code> <code>{
    code: 404,
    message: &#39;Not Found: resource not found&#39;
}</code></p>
