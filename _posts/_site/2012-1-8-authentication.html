<p>Authentication is handled by <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication/'>HTTP Basic Authentication</a>.</p>

<p>Every API request must include a <strong>valid authentication token</strong> in the header.</p>

<p>The Authorization header is constructed as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Username and password are combined into a string &#8220;username:password&#8221;</li>

<li>The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64</li>

<li>The authorization method and a space i.e. &#8220;Basic &#8221; is then put before the encoded string.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if the user agent uses &#8216;Aladdin&#8217; as the username and &#8216;open sesame&#8217; as the password then the header is formed as follows:</p>

<p><code>Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==</code></p>
